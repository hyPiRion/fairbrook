fairbrook is a Clojure library designed to make it easier to make more
fine-grained map merges. Its design is heavily based upon higher-order
functions: Most functions take one optional function as input and returns a
function. This is done to make it easy, yet simple, to design chains of rules.

fairbrook is compatible with clojure 1.2 up to 1.5-beta2, and has no other
dependencies. The API is finished, only some small correctness checks are needed
before it is deployed onto Clojars (better not have bugs because I didn't check
them well enough). However, you're free to fetch it through git clone and lein
install - the only change will be bugfixes (if any).

## Usage

To use fairbrook within your own Clojure programs and libraries, plug this in
within your `project.clj`:

```clj
[fairbrook "0.1.0"] ; (NB: not yet released)
```

To get a better understanding of fairbrook, have a look at the [tutorial](https://github.com/hyPiRion/fairbrook/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md).
