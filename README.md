fairbrook is a Clojure library designed to make it easier to make more
fine-grained map merges. Its design is heavily based upon higher-order
functions: Most functions take one optional function as input and returns a
function. This is done to make it easy, yet simple, to design chains of rules.

fairbrook is currently compatible with clojure 1.2 up to 1.5-beta2, and has no
other dependencies. It is also still in the design phase, but the current API
for `0.1.0` is more or less finished. However, if you're interested in using it,
please be patient for a couple of more days, for sanity's sake :)

## Usage

To use fairbrook within your own Clojure programs and libraries, plug this in
within your `project.clj`:

```clj
[fairbrook "0.1.0"] ; (NB: not yet released)
```

To get a better understanding of fairbrook, have a look at the tutorial when it
is written.
