# fairbrook

A Clojure library designed to make it easier to make more fine-grained map
merges while being modular, simple, composable and other buzzwords you may know
of; Its goal is to be as idiomatic Clojure as possible, and strives for good
design.

Fairbrook is currently in the design phase, but you can assume that the design
for 0.1.0 is more or less finished in a couple of days. Until then, a lot of
changes will occur, and touching the library from outside is not recommended.
